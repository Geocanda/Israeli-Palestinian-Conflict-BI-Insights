# Israeli-Palestinian-Conflict-BI-Insights
Unlock insights into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through this BI project. From ETL to predictive modeling with WEKA, we analyze data trends, casualties, and refugee stats, automating data extraction for efficiency.


Beginning with meticulous data collection from diverse sources, our project undergoes a rigorous ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to ensure data accuracy and consistency. We then embark on thorough data preprocessing, refining raw datasets to extract meaningful patterns and trends.

Utilizing advanced prediction techniques with WEKA, we forecast future scenarios and trends based on historical data, providing invaluable predictive analytics. Moreover, our project showcases seamless automation of data retrieval from multiple sources, streamlining the data collection process for enhanced efficiency and accuracy.

By integrating cutting-edge technologies and methodologies, our project offers a nuanced understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict's trajectory. Through our comprehensive approach encompassing ETL, data preprocessing, predictive modeling with WEKA, and automated data handling, we illuminate the multifaceted dimensions of this enduring geopolitical issue.
