# 🇮🇱🇵🇸 Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: A Data-Driven Analysis

This project provides data-driven insights into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict using Business Intelligence (BI) techniques. We cover the full analytical pipeline, from data extraction and preprocessing to predictive modeling, with an emphasis on exploring trends, casualties, and refugee statistics.

## 📜 Project Overview

This project aims to provide a data-driven understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by:

*   Performing Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes for data integration.
*   Implementing rigorous data preprocessing techniques for accuracy.
*   Using predictive modeling with WEKA for forecasting trends and scenarios.
*   Automating data retrieval from multiple sources to enhance efficiency.

## 🌟 Key Features

*   **Comprehensive ETL:** Robust data integration from diverse sources.
*   **Advanced Preprocessing:** Detailed data cleaning and refinement techniques.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** WEKA-based predictive analysis to uncover insights.
*   **Automated Data Handling:** Efficient and streamlined data retrieval processes.

## ⚙️ Data Analysis Pipeline

1.  **Data Collection & Extraction:**
    *   The project gathers data from diverse sources related to the conflict.
    *   Data extraction is automated to allow for continuous updates.

2.  **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Process:**
    *   **Extraction:** Data is extracted from the multiple sources and validated.
    *   **Transformation:** Data undergoes rigorous cleaning, formatting, and standardization to ensure consistency and accuracy.
    *   **Loading:** Processed data is loaded into a centralized data storage system for analysis.

3.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    *   Data is further refined through advanced preprocessing techniques to prepare it for modeling.
    *   Preprocessing includes handling missing values, and data normalization.
    *   Feature engineering was performed to capture trends in the data.

4.  **Predictive Modeling with WEKA:**
    *   WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) is used for predictive modeling.
    *   The tool was used to forecast future scenarios and trends related to the conflict using different machine learning algorithms.
   *   The goal was to provide valuable predictive analysis.

5.  **Automated Data Retrieval:**
    *   The project implements automated data extraction from multiple sources, streamlining data collection.
    *   This automation ensures that data is continuously collected and updated efficiently.
